# Return Rates

A collection of deposit rates for banks, crypto, and other institutions I've accumulated since January 2020. The information contained here is focused for the average consumer. If you have $100,000 you may have to dig into the rates more for higher interest. I currently do not list rates for youth, student, business, HSA, or IRA accounts. This may become available in the future.

## Assumptions

**Checking (CHK)**: If a financial institution offers multiple accounts then I try to select the one with no fees. You may be required to keep a small amount in the account to avoid fees at some financial institutions.

**Savings (SAV)**: TBD

**Money Market (MM)**: I try to focus rates for money market accounts with under $10,000. Any minimum amounts over $10,000 will be noted.

**Certificate of Deposit (CD)**: When looking at CDs I considered the average minimum amount being deposited around $1,000. Some institutions require less or have special/promotion CDs while other banks require significantly more. Anything over a $5,000 minimum will be noted. When looking at terms the terms listed may be less or more depending on the rates offered.

For example, if an institution offers a 12-month CD at 0.50% but offers a promotional 11-month CD at 2.0%. I will list the 11-month CD under the 12-month column with the higher interest rate. Another example is an institution offering a 18-month CD at 0.50% but offers a promotional 20-month CD at 2.0%. I will list the 20-month CD under the 18-month column with the higher interest rate. The delima comes in when an institution offers a 30-month promotional CD. I don't have a column for 30-months but I will typically list it under the 36-month column if the rate is higher than the 36-month rate offered.

Not all institutions offer all the terms listed just as not all institutions offer the account types listed.

Some institutions offer what are called Jumbo accounts or Super-Jumbo accounts. Usually the minimum deposit amount for a Jumbo account is $100,000. The usual minimum amount for a Super-Jumbo account is $250,000.

## Terms

Below you will find terms used in the notes column.

### Tiered Rates

Tiered rates are rates that ascend as the money in the account increases. See the table below for an example.

| Amount | APY |
| ------ | --- |
| $0 - $500 | 1.00% |
| $501 - $10,000 | 3.00% |
| $10,001 - $25,000 | 4.00% |

### Reverse Tiered Rates

Reverse tiered rates are rates that descend as the money in the account increases. See the table below for an example.

| Amount | APY |
| ------ | --- |
| $0 - $500 | 6.00% |
| $501 - $5,000 |2.00% |
| $5,001 - $10,000 | 1.00% |

### With Requirements

With requirements can mean multiple things. These are usually seen on checking accounts.

**Spend requirement**: You must spend a pre-determined amount of money in the specified time period.

**Transaction requirement**: You must perform a pre-determined amount of Point of Sale transactions in the specified time period. This may include debit card and/or credit card transactions.

**Deposit requirement**: You must deposit a pre-determined amount of money into the account in the specified time period. This can be from a payroll check, investment account, other bank account, and other forms of compensation.

**Direct deposit requirement**: Your deposits must come from a payroll deposit or government agency paying benefits. Some institutions will consider deposits from specific accounts as a direct deposit. I recommend checking out [Doctor of Credit list of Banks](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/knowledge-base/list-methods-banks-count-direct-deposits/) to see what others have said worked in the past.

**eStatements requirement**: You must sign up for electronic bank statements. This means you will not receive a paper bank statement. You may still receive a paper end of year tax statements.

**Savings requirement**: You must save a percentage of the amount deposited per time period. For example, if an institution requires a 10% savings requirement and you deposit $100, then you must move $10 to the required account.

**Minimum balance requirement**: You must keep a specific amount of money in the account at all times to avoid fees or to gain interest. If the amount drops below that amount at anytime you may be charged a fee or no longer gain interest on the money.

**Average daily balance requirement**: The average balance of your account every day of the specified time period, usually monthly, must be above the minimum required balance. If the average daily balance is below the required minimum at the end of the required period you may be charged a fee or not gain interest on the amount in the account.

### Up to [Amount]

The maximum amount of money the rate listed will be paid out for. Any money over the maximum amount listed is either paid out at a flat reduced rate or no rate at all. Below are two examples.

Bank 1 offers 5.0% up to $1,000 and then offers 0% on any amount over $1,000.

Bank 2 offers 4.0% up to $4,000 and then offers 1.5% on any amount over $4,000.
